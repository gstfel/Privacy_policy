For the purposes of a university project, we will collect information about the content of posts, the subreddit they are posted in, many comments and how much karma said posts receive, as well as the upvote ratios. Post titles and usernames will not be collected and usernames in the text will be censoder. The following two subreddits will be analyzed: /r/Atlanta and /r/elderscrollsonline.

The posts will be categorized according to popularity (based on karma and replies). The content of the posts will be analyzed via computer learning and used to predict popularity.
The data will be stored on students' personal computers, and servers hosted by the Vienna University of Economics and Business. Subsequently the data will be shared with Vienna University of Economics and Business. The raw data collected by the API will be stored for no more than 30 days.
The data will be used for a university project dealing with the scalable handling of big data and understanding legal fundamentals and ethical frameworks in dealing with data in an international context. Results will be submitted to the university and presented in class. The purpose of this project is educational and the collected data will not be used for business purposes.
